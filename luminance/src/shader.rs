//! Shader stages, programs and uniforms.
//!
//! This module contains everything related to _shaders_. Shader programs — shaders, for short —
//! are GPU binaries that run to perform a series of transformation. Typically run when a draw
//! command is issued, they are responsible for:
//!
//! - Transforming vertex data. This is done in a _vertex shader_. Vertex data, such as the
//!   positions, colors, UV coordinates, bi-tangents, etc. of each vertices will go through the
//!   vertex shader and get transformed based on the code provided inside the stage. For example,
//!   vertices can be projected on the screen with a perspective and view matrices.
//! - Tessellating primitive patches. This is done in _tessellation shaders_.
//! - Filtering, transforming again or even generating new vertices and primitives. This is done
//!   by the _geometry shader_.
//! - And finally, outputting a color for each _fragment_ covered by the objects you render. This
//!   is done by the _fragment shader_.
//!
//! # Shader stages
//!
//! Right now, five shader stages  — [`Stage`] — are supported, ordered by usage in the graphics
//! pipeline:
//!
//! 1. [`StageType::VertexShader`].
//! 2. [`StageType::TessellationControlShader`].
//! 3. [`StageType::TessellationEvaluationShader`].
//! 4. [`StageType::GeometryShader`].
//! 5. [`StageType::FragmentShader`].
//!
//! Those are not all mandatory: only the _vertex_ stage and _fragment_ stages are mandatory. If
//! you want tessellation shaders, you have to provide both of them.
//!
//! Shader stages — [`Stage`] — are compiled independently at runtime by your GPU driver, and then
//! _linked_ into a shader program. The creation of a [`Stage`] implies using an input string,
//! representing the _source code_ of the stage. This is an opaque [`String`] that must represent
//! a GLSL stage. The backend will transform the string into its own representation if needed.
//!
//! > For this version of the crate, the GLSL string must be at least 330-compliant. It is possible
//! > that this changes in the future to be more flexible, but right now GLSL 150, for instance, is
//! > not allowed.
//!
//! # Shader program
//!
//! A shader program — [`Program`] is akin to a binary program, but runs on GPU. It is invoked when
//! you issue draw commands. It will run each stages you’ve put in it to transform vertices and
//! rasterize fragments inside a framebuffer. Once this is done, the framebuffer will contain
//! altered fragments by the final stage (fragment shader). If the shader program outputs several
//! properties, we call that situation _MRT_ (Multiple Render Target) and the framebuffer must be
//! configured to be able to receive those outputs — basically, it means that its _color slots_
//! and/or _depth slots_ must adapt to the output of the shader program.
//!
//! Creating shader programs is done by gathering the [`Stage`] you want and _linking_ them. Some
//! helper methods allow to create a shader [`Program`] directly from the string source for each
//! stage, removing the need to build each stage individually.
//!
//! Shader programs are typed with three important piece of information:
//!
//! - The vertex [`Semantics`].
//! - The render target outputs.
//! - The [`UniformInterface`].
//!
//!
//! # Vertex semantics
//!
//! When a shader program runs, it first executes the mandatory _vertex stage on a set of
//! vertices. Those vertices have a given format — that is described by the [`Vertex`] trait.
//! Because running a shader on an incompatible vertex would yield wrong results, both the
//! vertices and the shader program must be tagged with a type which must implement the
//! [`Semantics`] trait. More on that on the documentation of [`Semantics`].
//!
//! # Render target outputs
//!
//! A shader program, in its final mandatory _fragment stage_, will write values into the currently
//! in-use framebuffer. The number of “channels” to write to represents the render targets.
//! Typically, simple renders will simply write the color of a pixel — so only one render target.
//! In that case, the type of the output of the shader program must match the color slot of the
//! framebuffer it is used with.
//!
//! However, it is possible to write more data. For instance,
//! [deferred shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading) is a technique that requires
//! to write several data to a framebuffer, called G-buffer (for geometry buffer): space
//! coordinates, normals, tangents, bi-tangents, etc. In that case, your framebuffer must have
//! a type matching the outputs of the fragment shader, too.
//!
//! # Shader customization
//!
//! A shader [`Program`] represents some code, in a binary form, that transform data. If you
//! consider such code, it can adapt to the kind of data it receives, but the behavior is static.
//! That means that it shouldn’t be possible to ask the program to do something else — shader
//! programs don’t have a state as they must be spawned in parallel for your vertices, pixels, etc.
//! However, there is a way to dynamically change what happens inside a shader program. That way
//!
//! The concept is similar to environment variables: you can declare, in your shader stages,
//! _environment variables_ that will receive values from the host (i.e. on the Rust side). It is
//! not possible to change those values while a draw command is issued: you have to change them
//! in between draw commands. For this reason, those environment variables are often called
//! _constant buffers_, _uniform_, _uniform buffers_, etc. by several graphics libraries. In our
//! case, right now, we call them [`Uniform`].
//!
//! ## Uniforms
//!
//! A [`Uniform`] is parametric type that accepts the type of the value it will be able to change.
//! For instance, `Uniform<f32>` represents a `f32` that can be changed in a shader program. That
//! value can be set by the Rust program when the shader program is not currently in use — no
//! draw commands.
//!
//! A [`Uniform`] is a _single_ variable that allows the most basic form of customization. It’s
//! very similar to environment variables. You can declare several ones as you would declare
//! several environment variables. More on that on the documentation of [`Uniform`].
//!
//! ## Uniform buffers
//!
//! > This section is under heavy rewriting, both the documentation and API.
//!
//! Sometimes, you will want to set and pass around rich and more complex data. Instead of a `f32`,
//! you will want to pass a `struct`. This operation is currently supported but highly unsafe. The
//! reason for this is that your GPU will expect a specific kind of memory layout for the types
//! you use, and that also depends on the backend you use.
//!
//! Also, passing a lot of data is not very practical with default [`Uniform`] directly.
//!
//! In order to pass more data or `struct`s, you need to create a [`Buffer`]. That buffer will
//! simply contain the data / object(s) you want to pass to the shader. It is then possible, via
//! the use of a [`Pipeline`], to retrieve a [`BoundBuffer`], which can be used to get a
//! [`BufferBinding`]. That [`BufferBinding`] can then be set on a
//! `Uniform<BufferBinding<YourType>>`, telling your shader program where to grab the data — from
//! the bound buffer.
//!
//! This way of doing is very practical and powerful but currently, in this version of the crate,
//! very unsafe. A better API will be available in a next release to make all this simpler and
//! safer.
//!
//! ## Uniform interfaces
//!
//! As with vertex semantics and render targets, the uniforms that can be used with a shader program
//! are part of its type, too, and represented by a single type that must implement
//! [`UniformInterface`]. That type can contain anything, but it is advised to just put [`Uniform`]
//! fields in it. More on the [`UniformInterface`] documentation.
